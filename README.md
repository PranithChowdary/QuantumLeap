# Graph Coloring

A demo of graph coloring using Leap's hybrid constrained quadratic model (CQM)
solver.

Figure: The graph that we want to color with no neighboring nodes the same color.

We want to color this graph so that no neighboring nodes have the same color.
[Graph coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) is a well-known hard problem and an alternative formulation is
available in this collection of code examples (see [Map Coloring](https://github.com/dwave-examples/map-coloring)). In this example,
we formulate this problem as a constrained quadratic model (CQM) and solve it
using the hybrid CQM solver.

## Usage

To run the graph coloring demo, enter the command:

```bash
python graph_coloring.py
```

The program will print out the number of colors used and whether or not the
solution is valid, and produce an image of the solution saved as
`result_graph.png`.

Also included is a map coloring demo, `map_coloring.py`. To run the map
coloring demo, enter the command:

```bash
python map_coloring.py
```

The map coloring demo has an option to run on the Canadian map (`-c canada`) or
the USA map (`-c usa`, default) and produces an output image file as shown
below.

## Code Overview

The hybrid CQM solver accepts problems expressed in terms of a
ConstrainedQuadraticModel object. A CQM consists of an objective and/or
constraints, both formulated as Quadratic Models (QMs). In this model, the
problem is formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem and does not have an
objective.

In this problem, we define binary variables as ordered pairs (node, color). For
example, the pair `(1, 2)` corresponds to node 1 and color 2. In the map
coloring example, the pair will look like `('Maryland', 0)` to indicate that
the state of Maryland should be colored with color 0 in the USA map. If
variable `(n, i)` equals 1 then we assign node `n` color `i`.

### Constraints

In this example, we have two groups of constraints.

#### Discrete Constraints

Since each node must be assigned exactly one color, we need a set of discrete
constraints: one constraint for each node `n` so that it is assigned exactly
one color.

#### Edge Constraints

Our assignment of colors to nodes must satisfy the constraint that no edge has
endpoints with the same color. In terms of map coloring, this is equivalent to
the constraint that no adjacent regions having the same colors assigned.

To build this constraint, we consider each edge `(u, v)` independently, and
each possible color independently as well. For edge `(u, v)` and color `i`, we
want to ensure that binary variables `(u, i)` and `(v, i)` are not both equal
to 1. All other combinations are acceptable. We can determine an expression for
this using a truth table, as shown below.

|`(u,i)`|`(v,i)`|Acceptable?|
|-----|------|-----|
|0|0|Yes (0) |
|0|1|Yes (0) |
|1|0|Yes (0) |
|1|1|No (1) |

By using one value (0) to denote "Yes" and a different value (1) to denote
"No", we are able to formulate a mathematical expression to build the
constraint. This constraint can be expressed as `(u,i) * (v,i) == 0`.
